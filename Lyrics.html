<h1>ORGANELLEXTRAVAGANZA</h1>
<h3>Song by Wonjunucleus Lee and Tyler VacUhl</h3>


<p><br><br><br>
Uh Organerds, yuh...
<br>
<br>
CHORUS:
<br>
This is a song on organelles
<br>
We talk about whats inside the cells
<br>
So listen close to what we’re ‘bout to say
<br>
It’ll help you on the test day
<br>
<br>
Wonjunucleus Lee!!!!
<br>
<br>
The cytoplasm fills the empty space
<br>
It makes the cell a very snug place
<br>
<br>
Chromatin is filled with protein and DNA
<br>
It is in the nucleus and essential everyday
<br>
<br>
ER is abbreviation of Endoplasmic Reticulum
<br>
And it is easier to understand than algebra curriculum
<br>
<br>
Rough ER helps assemble proteins
<br>
Attached are ribosomes to help cells work like machines
<br>
<br>
Another type is smooth ER
<br>
No ribosomes where they are
<br>
<br>
Nucleus, the most important just like brain
<br>
Organelles follow nucleus including cell membrane
<br>
<br>
***CHORUS***
<br>
<br>
Tyler VacUhl!!!!!
<br>
<br>
Cell membrane protects the cell with its phospholipid bilayer
<br>
They are like 200 lbs defensive football player
<br>
<br>
The Mitochondria uses cellular respiration
<br>
To break down nutrients and produce more energy than the US nation
Ha Sike
<br>
<br>
Nucleolus creates ribosomes also known as rRNA
<br>
This is a copy of the DNA
<br>
<br>
The Vacuoles store and transports
<br>
Its like the ships commin’ in and out ports
<br>
<br>
Cytoskeleton gives cells shape and coherence with 3 protein filaments
<br>
Oh gosh that’s magnificently brilliant 
<br>
<br>
Chloroplast is where photosynthesis happen
<br>
Double membranes make thylakoids trapped in
<br>
<br>
***CHORUS***
<br>
<br>
Uh Organerds, yuh...
<br>
<br>
This is a song for Mr. DNA
<br>
And this is finally de end, ayeeeee
